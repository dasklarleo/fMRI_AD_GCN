# 三个容易混淆的概念

- T2 image
  - a MR contrast just like T1,T2
  - Can be used for BOLD, DSC, QSM, UTE...
- BOLD
  - T2 change due to the presence of the deoxyhemoglobin
  - The main technique for the Brain 
- fMRI
  - Just used for the Brain
  - Most use the BOLD, bur also ASL

# BOLD

## Principle and image acquisition

red bolld cells and hemoglobin(血红蛋白)

oxygen in the blood:

- In the blood cells: quantified by the "Oxygen Saturation"
- dissolved in the plasma: quantified by the "Oxygen partial Pressure"

If the hemoglobin carried 4 $O_2$ it would be be diamagnetic, while if it carries less than 4 $O_2$, it would be paramagnetic which cause the distoration of the magnetic fields around it.

Low T2 means high dHB, which also means low $O_2$
